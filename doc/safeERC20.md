[SafeERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20) is a wrapper around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful.
